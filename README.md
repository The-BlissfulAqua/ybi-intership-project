# AIML Project: Simple Chatbot
Chatbots are AI programs that talk like humans using text or voice. They use AI and language understanding to reply to what you say.

## How a Chatbot Works:
- You type or speak: You start by giving the chatbot a message.

- Chatbot understands: It uses AI to figure out what you mean. Simple chatbots look for keywords, while smarter ones understand your intention.

- Chatbot replies: It finds an answer from its information and sends it back. This could be a simple answer, a detailed one, or a question to understand you better.

- Conversation continues: You get the reply, and you can keep talking, asking more questions, or giving more details.

## Conclusion:
This basic chatbot works as planned. It greets you, answers simple questions, remembers past talks, guides conversations, and handles mistakes well.
